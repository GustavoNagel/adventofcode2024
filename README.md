# Advent of Code 2024 using Rust

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. This year, I used Rust.

Command to run:
```
cargo run -- 1 2
```
Where the first argument is the advent of code day (1 - 25) and the second is the part (1 - 2).
